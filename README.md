# Boston-House-Price-Prediction-and-Deployment
We performed predictions for Boston house prices by employing twelve regression models. The implementation was deployed through Flask and hosted on the AWS Cloud platform.

## Utilized Technologies
Python: The primary programming language employed in the project.

Flask (Web Framework): Utilized for constructing the web application.

scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library): Employed for implementing machine learning models for price prediction.

HTML/CSS (Frontend): Responsible for crafting the user interface.

AWS Cloud: The project is hosted on the AWS cloud.

## Features
Input Fields: Users can input key features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, etc.

Prediction: The system predicts the median housing cost based on the provided input.

User-Friendly Interface: The web interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
